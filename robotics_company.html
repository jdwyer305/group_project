    <h4>Charlie Andersen</h4>
    <h4>CEO</h4>
  <p class="text-justify">Charlie grew up on a 191 acre working fruit, vegetable, and livestock farm. This experience lead him to believe that all tedious farm labor should be automated, and simultaneously to understand the many challenges that robots face in agriculture. He founded Augean Robotics after gaining experience with Case New Holland, John Deere's largest competitor, where he reported to the head of the North American operating unit and worked on special projects across sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution. He received a BA from Amherst College, and an MBA from Harvard Business School.</p>
